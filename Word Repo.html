    <h2>The problem</h2>
 
    <p><b>When people are learning new vocabulary, they can often get frustrated with unorganized online personal learning materials, time management and old learning models that don't fit into their busy lives. How might we create an application that helps users expand their vocabulary and boost their confidence in an efficient and modern way? </b></p>
        
    <img src="images/WR vocabulary.png" width=35% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 
 

    <h2>How did I come up with the idea?</h2>

    <p>I was once an international student, now I am living and working in the US, and I have realized that my previous language learning style and traditional tools don’t fit into my current lifestyle and work needs anymore. </p>

    <p>I am constantly learning new words and terms related to my jobs. I am currently a UX/UI designer. Also, me and my partner own a real estate company and we flip houses. Part-time, I am a personal cook. I’m always seeing new words, and I am always googling. The traditional dictionary applications can not satisfy my needs anymore, I do need the basic meaning of a word, but also more in-depth meanings in a professional context that can help me understand words in a professional way. Furthermore, I am just a normal guy, and that means that sometimes I will forget what I previously studied, so I often need to refer back, but referring back means I have to google all over again and find the exact website I found before, it’s just painful…..    </p>

    <p><b><font color="#586691">For example</font></b>, I am researching the word “gluten” on Google because one of my cooking business clients requests a gluten-free dinner. I will first check out a couple of the search results on Google and click some of them to see details, and then maybe move on to the next and next search pages until I find a website that describes “gluten” in a way that really gives me all the aspects of the meaning and explanations that I want to know as a personal chef.     </p>
    <p><b><font color="#586691">However</font></b>…….. the research and study doesn’t stop there……. 
    </p>

    <p><b><font color="#586691">After a couple weeks</font></b>, because of my job, I need to verify and see if I remember correctly how gluten impacts people’s health. Of course, I didn’t save the link to my bookmarks because bookmarks are already packed with other old saved links. So I have to google the word “gluten” all over again and hopefully I will find the exact website as last time. If I am unlucky or inpatient at that moment, I will never find the same website. The searching of the exact website is painful and time consuming.
    </p>

    <p><b><font color="#586691">There must be a way to fix this issue, to make my learning easier and more personal, and make my previous online research easily accessible.</font></b>
    </p>

    <h2>The starting point - Hypothesis Statement</h2>
 
    <p>After talking with my teammates about my idea, they are all interested and think this kind of app will also speed up their learning process. Then we try to empathize with our potential users and form our hypothesis statement:</p>

    <p>
      <b>We believe that by creating an app that helps users expand their vocabulary in real time by storing the words and terms into organized lists with recommended references, and keep footprints of their research, storing their reliable resources for easy study reference. Such an app we believe will increase the user's vocabulary comprehension by streamlining and organizing their learning experience. </b>
    </p>

          
    
    

    <h2>Proto Persona</h2>

    <p>
      Proto persona is hypothetical starting point to consider: <b>Who is our user?</b> It’s an educated guess, will need to be validated through more user research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, we have two proto personas that me and my teammate Charlie created: one is a native English speaking young professional who has the need of learning new words to inspire his creativity, and the other proto persona is a young professional from Korea who is constantly learning new words and wants to break the culture and language barrier and master coding. 
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR proto persona2.png" width=50% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 
 


    <h2>Research: Phase 1 - Online Survey</h2>

    <p>Proto personas are used as a starting point. It is the role of us as researchers to validate or invalidate the proto-persona.</p>

    <p>
      We chose to start with online surveys. We prepared a survey with Google Forms and distributed it among people who are young professionals on social media like Facebook, Instagram and Wechat. Wechat really helped us to understand international English speakers. The surveys helped us gain quantitative data of users’ learning style, what kind of platform they use to find word meanings, what kind of dictionary app features they enjoy and what kind of features they wish a dictionary app to have. The purpose was to discover the pain points of users’ learning and researching process of trying to expand their vocabulary. Learning about the problems of potential users is a good way to get inspired. Working with real world quantitative data is a good starting point to help avoid guesswork and bias. From these results we were able to refine the questions to ask the users during the interviews.
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR PieChart3.png" width=40% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    
    <h2>Research: Phase 2 - The Interviews</h2>

   

    <p>
      The data we collected from the surveys showed us quantitative data in the areas of our potential users’ current learning styles and what other features they think will improve their vocabulary learning overall. 
    </p>

    <p>Then we moved to in person interviews. We interviewed 6 people, because 6 interviews can identify 80% of themes within a data set.</p>

    <p>During the interviews we were able to ask more specific questions about how users learn and retain the definition of the new word for future use. We also asked them about the different phases of learning a new word, how do they refer back to where they learned the word in the first place, and how they store their personal notes when they are learning a new term. During the interview, we really try to watch the changes of their emotion, and try to dig in and get to know what is bothering them and what potential solutions they prefer. 
    </p>

    

    <img src="images/WR user quotes.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 



    <h2>Research: Phase 3 - Online research</h2>

    <p>
      According to our interview and online survey with users, we found a very interesting and surprising fact that most people say they need to see a word 4 times to be able to memorize it. 
    </p>

    <p>We thought there must be a scientific explanation for that.  So our amazing teammate Ji Li did some online research and he found out that according to <a href='https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/Writing%20Program/forgetting_curve.pdf'><b><font color="#0027FF">memory curve</font></b></a>, memory immediately fades away after you just learned, unless you keep repeating what you have learned. And it takes 4 times of repetition to memorize, and the 4 times should happen right after your first time learned, 24 hours later, 1 week later (or sooner) and 1 month later (or sooner). 
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR memory curve.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <p>
      This online research finding perfectly matches the data from our users through interviews and online survey. We think this finding is very valuable and we should design a learning function feature that based on the scientific memory curve to remind our users to study and help them achieve their goals with less efforts. 
    </p>

    <h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>

    <p>As designers, we want to understand our users. Often, we need as many data points as possible to tell that story.The affinity diagram helped us to create categories and narrow our focus. After a few iterations of the diagram we were able to understand our users’ needs and wants. 
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR in class room with JI Li & Charlie.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <p>Combine the qualitative and quantitative data, we discovered valuable user insights and pain points: </p>

    <img src="images/WR user insights.png" width=45% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <img src="images/WR pain points.png" width=45% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <p>All of the pain points from our users has a commonality: “not having enough time!” I think this is a breaking point for the development of our app.  It really helped us set the idea and the direction of the app we are building. We have to make sure the use of the app is fast, and all the design need to obey the law:  <b>“saving user’s time and get where user wants to go as fast as possible”. </b></p>

     
    <h2>Empathy Map</h2>

    <p>Empathy is understanding the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of another person. We built empathy maps after initial user research to gain
      deeper insights into users and provides a glance into who our user is as a whole. Also sheds light on which problems to solve and how. Most importantly it helps quick and easy to iterate, and get all team members to the same page to understand what our users think, feel, see, say and do. 
      </p>

    <img src="images/WR Empathy Map.jpg" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 


    <h2>User persona</h2>


    <p>Based on qualitative and quantitative user research and web research, we decided to not distinguish native English speaker users and international English speaker users, because they all encounter new words everyday and they all need a new dictionary app to satisfy their need of easily expanding vocabulary and organize personal online study materials. </p>

    <p>Also the app is still a dictionary utility app to its core, but with more advanced features. If an international English speaker only wants to find out the basic meaning of a word, they can still search in our app and the app will provide the basic meanings to make them satisfied. 
    </p>

    <p>We then created a user persona who is a restaurant owner who is taking courses in nutrition, and she feels like the traditional dictionary app can’t give her the explanations she needs. She is always busy with her business and sometimes she forgets definitions of terms so she needs a place to refer back to them fast and easily. She wants to spend her valuable time on learning, not on finding. </p>

    <img src="images/WR User Persona.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 


    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <p>Next, to identify the gap between the current state and the desired state of user’s unmet need. We use problem statement to reveal user’s core pain points and the direction of the solution.  </p>
    
    <img src="images/WR problem statement.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <h2>I wish, I like, and what if</h2>

    <p>
      Next, with our problem statement in our mind and all the user insights we collected from our users, we started the brainstorming phase to generate a bunch of ideas quickly. We believe all ideas should be heard, and there are no stupid ideas.  We use I Like, I Wish, What If tool that looks at ideas through the lens of the present, the near future and the distant future, then we put stars on the ideas that we think can fundamentally solve our user’s problems. 

    </p>

    <img src="images/WR I wish, I like, and what if .png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 


    <h2>Features Prioritization Matrix and competitor analysis: </h2>

    

    <p>
      All the ideas we have are great, but we can’t turn them all into the features in the app, we have to decide on which idea will solve user’s core problem and elevate the user's experience, also is feasible. We also referred back to our interview and survey data and try to validate our ideas based on user’s needs and wants, and think which features will bring the most value to the user and what is feasible. From there we use Features Prioritization Matrix to define the features we decide to develop. 

    </p>

    <img src="images/WR Features Prioritization Matrix .png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <p>
      UX design is not only about improving the usability for users, but also to encourage user behavior that will drive business success. Our team member Ji Li did Competitor Analysis to see what our direct and indirect competitors are doing.  
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR competitive.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 

    <p>
      With our user’s needs and our competitor in mind, the features we decided on are:   
    </p>

    <div class="listContainer">

            <ol class="list">
            
              <li>1. Users can save a word from web browser to our app directly, also organize words into categories to make words more accessible.  (core function)</li>
              <li>2. Allows users to refer back to their online research materials. (core function)</li>
              <li>3. Users can control the notification frequency. (core function)</li>
              <li>4. Index cards game to learn words. (core function)</li>
              <li>5. Voice input and camera mode to save user typing words, therefore save time. </li>
              <li>6. Slower pronunciation of words. </li>
              <li>7. Basic dictionary app functions like pronunciation, meanings and with example sentences from official resource. </li>
             
            </ol>
 
    </div>


    <h2>Value Propositions</h2>
 
    <p>
      To be able to communicate our product’s value to users, I came up with our value propositions based on what we can bring to our users and why we are better and different from other like kind apps: 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Word Repo makes your vocabulary learning personal and effective. </b>
    </p>


    <h2>Storytelling (StoryBoard)
    </h2>
 
    <p>
      Words can only accomplish so much during a product development, so we need graphics and some “drama” to communicate ideas quickly with team members, also to understand and iterate the flow of user’s interaction with the app. 
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR storyboard.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 




    <h2>Task Flow and User Flow</h2>
 
    <p>
      We had a vague idea of how the app will function, but before we begin wireframing and prototyping which are all very time consuming, we decided to do task flow and user flow first, to map out each step user complete a task. We first sketched on paper, then we made a digital version to make it accessible to team members.
    </p>

    <img src="images/WR task flow.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 
    <img src="images/WR user flow.png" width=35% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 





    <h2>Sketches (Paper prototyping)
    </h2>

    <img src="images/homepage with drop down.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 
 
    <p>
      Paper prototyping is fast, and you can change it anytime you want, it’s very convenient for fast iteration. Each of our team members did sketches for one of the core functions. This was the first step to help us visually imagine the app.
 

    </p>






    <h2>Wireframes and Lo-Fi Prototype User Testing</h2>

    <img src="images/homepage with drop down.png" width=60% class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image"> 
 
    <p>
      Paper prototype is fast and good for iteration, but it’s too messy to do user testing with it. Therefore, we divide lo-fi prototyping missions to three team members and each of us is in charge of one of the core functions. 


    </p>

    <p>
      Then, we made lo-fi clickable and started our lo-fi prototype testing with 6 users who are young professionals. These are the 4 tasks we designed for the user testing:
      
    </p>

    <p>
      During the testing, the users shared their thoughts about the feel of the application and its ease of use. 
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Our lo-fi testing proved that the simplicity of the app was there, however 5 users said that instead of telling them to “save” the word to the application, we should tell them to “share” the word to the app, since in IOS the only way to interact with a third party app is to click “share”: 

    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, we should educate our user in the on-boarding pages, and tell them how to “save (share)” a word to the app. 

    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, 4 users reported that there were too many steps in the saving process: 

    </p>

    <div class="listContainer">

      <ol class="list">
      
        <li>1. click “share”.</li>
        <li>2. click “Vocab”.</li>
        <li>3. click “save”.</li>
        <li>4. choose the category you want to save the word to.</li>
        <li>5. then click “done” to finish saving or click “add personal notes” to add your notes.</li>
    
       
      </ol>

    </div>

    <p>
      Instead of making “saving a word” a five click process with pop up pages and different interfaces, we have to cut that process much shorter to reduce users’ cognitive load. Also, during our user research phase, we discovered the biggest pain point of our users, they don’t want to waste any time, they want to get things done fast. 

    </p>


    <p>
      Therefore, after talking with teammates and really empathize with our users, and try to facilitate intricate tasks and workflows, I redesigned the flow of saving a word to our app: 
    </p>


    <div class="listContainer">

      <ol class="list">
      
        <li>1. click “share”.</li>
        <li>2. click “Vocab”, then automatically the word and the URL will be saved to the app.</li>
        <li>3. If you want to organize the word to a category, you then just click “choose lists”, and here the page will push up, so users will still feel like they are on the same page, again, to reduce the cognitive load. </li>
        <li>4. after choose the category “biology”, the page shrink and show “saved to biology”, then the page will disappear itself in 2 seconds or users can have plenty of empty space at the upper section of the screen to click and exit.</li>
       
      </ol>

    </div>

    <p>
      With this design change, users will only need to go through 3 different interfaces to save a word, and they also have the flexibility to choose to save to a category or not. 

    </p>

    <p>
      Later on, when we did our hi-fi prototype with our users, they all liked this work flow better. Save users’ time and make them happy! 
    </p>

    <p>
      Users loved that they were able to access the link where they originally found the word. 

    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the users were confused about the “repository” icon, they think it’s a “home” icon. After some considerations, we changed the “repository” icon to a book like graphic with bookmark to represent the concept of “saving and referring back later”.  We also decided to add text to indicate the tab functions, because this is more direct and can eliminate users guessing the meaning of each tab. 
    </p>
